Platform / DevOps Engineer focused on Linux, Kubernetes and automation.

I build small tools to simplify real workflows and learn by shipping.

### What I'm working on

  - Hands-on scenarios for learning and experimentation
 
### How I build
- I prefer simple tools over complex stacks
- I optimize for clarity and maintainability
